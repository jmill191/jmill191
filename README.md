### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is James Miller. I am a Human Systems Engineering major at ASU. I am not sure what life is going to look like post-graduation, but I am very excited to find out!

I am pretty focused on human research as a part of my field, but coding is very interesting to me. I enjoy doing a lot of things but a new hobby I recently picked up is Ballroom Dance.
